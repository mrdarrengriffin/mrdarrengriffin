ðŸ’» As a software developer, I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of web technology. Currently, I'm immersed in the world of web performance, front-end animations, and exploring the basics of WebGL/3D.

ðŸ¤ª I've lived with ADHD for over 20 years and it has taught me to harness the power of hyperfocus, although it's a double-edged sword. Balancing productivity can be challenging when medication wears off, but I have ways of dealing with that. I also struggle with a bit of anxiety in certain situations, it's just one of those things!

ðŸš€ My core principle is to explore what excites me, have fun, and share my findings with others. Sometimes I might come across as a bit exuberant, but I'm just genuinely excited and passionate about the subject matter and the industry in general. I also welcome feedback with open arms to further improve where I can!

ðŸ’¡ Innovation drives me. Whether it's bringing ideas to life, delving into complex problems, or learning from others' insights, I'm in my element. It's not always about polished results; it's about learning, experimenting, and sharing insights with others.

ðŸŽ¾ Beyond the screen, I'll be on the tennis court. Tennis is my sanctuary, where I have an absolute blast, unwind from stress, and escape with my passionâ€”thanks in no small part to my amazing coach!
